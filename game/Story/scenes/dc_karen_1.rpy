    k "So, I'll have that coin now, please."
    mc "Uh, sure, here you go."

    k "Well, it's a little joke between him and me, so this is him telling me you're okay."
    mc "Thanks, I guess?"

    mc "Really? Cool!"
    k "Hop on board, we can go right away if you like."

    k "So, what's your deal, anyway?"
    mc "Uh, I'm...a writer, actually I came here on vacation to unwind and find some inspiration, you know?"
    mc "And Yggy said I should hike up to Lover's Peak, that was sure to help."
    k "Oh yeah, that'll do it."
    k "Wait, what was your name again? Ellen?"

    k "Oh my god, you HAVE to talk to her."
    k "Look, here is your coin back if you promise to talk to her."
    k "She's, like, probably your biggest fan out here, and she is our own little radio host."
    k "She has a recording studio up in an old firewatch guardtower that's been taken out of commission, that alone is worth a visit."
    scene 167 at topleft with dis
    mc "That does sound super relaxing!"
    k "Totally, I love hanging out with her there."
    k "And, I'm sure she would LOVE to have you on her show, even if it's just for a little moment and a few questions."
    mc "You know, that actually sounds like a lot of fun..."
    k "You won't regret it. Wait, let me write down her number for you, and if you don't mind, I'll let her know who's in town."

    k "Hah, I see you have met Ragnar as well."
    mc "What's he mean by that, anyway?"

    k "Most times."

    k "So, uh, I'll probably head back over soon, but you can always use that phone over there to call if I'm on the other side."
    k "I take off at eight, so you better be back by then."
    mc "Got it, thank you."
    k "Little word to the wise, I would take the left path up, then the right path down."
    k "That way, you catch the best view on your way up, and the way down is lit with a few lanterns in case you only make it back down after sundown."
    mc "Thank you!"
    k "Have fun, and don't forget to give my friend Patty a call sometime."
    mc "I won't."

    "It felt as if I...wasn't alone out there, and like the whole forest was brimming with life..."
    "And not just the birds, either."
    "It felt more like a general...presence, that was out there, entwined with the forest like ivy growing on the bark."
    scene 172 at topleft with dis
    "And then, finally, I ran out of mountain to climb, and reached the summit."
    scene 173 at topleft with dis

    "The air was brimming with silence, and not a soul was to be seen around."
    scene 174 at topleft with dis

            "It's hard to say what it was about the place, but the atmosphere damn near dragged my pants off of me, and I could feel invisible fingers running along my hips, following the contours of my body on their way down..."

            "There was no urgency to the situation, nobody likely to come up anytime soon..."

            "I just couldn't help it, I was too hungry for illicit touches, and there simply was nobody but me around to administer them."
            "No matter how much I might stare at the trees, hoping someone might step out of them..."
            "But of course, nobody did, nobody came out to laugh at me, or ask if I needed any help - and heck, nobody came to take me without even asking."
