    k "So, uh, I'll probably head back over soon, but you can always use that phone over there to call if I'm on the other side."
    k "I take off at eight, so you better be back by then."
    mc "Got it, thank you."
    k "Little word to the wise, I would take the left path up, then the right path down."
    k "That way, you catch the best view on your way up, and the way down is lit with a few lanters in case you only make it back down after sundown."
    mc "Thank you!"
    k "Have fun, and don't forget to give my friend Patty a call sometime."
    mc "I won't."
