    scene black at topleft with dis #todo
    #todo party (see if I can pull off some metal-like cover song with AI voices like the rap songs, will be interesting).
    "This scene is not yet ready to play, I will work on it as soon as I find the time. Thanks for your understanding."

    #this scene takes place in the statue circle from dc_cock_1 render
    #If we talk to mary, she will tell us that the "real purpose" is to draw the shadows away from the town before the big parade. If we continue that conversation, she will tell us that the more noise the crowd makes, the better it all works - and we can joke that dancing naked would probably do it. --> Mary is game, and the two can dance on stage, naked, and the crowd goes wild over it.
    #Talking to yggy, we can ask him if he has anything special for us (if we talked about the potion etc.) -> at which point he will respond that the music itself expands the minds of anyone who is able to feel it, rather than just listening to it. We can dance with him,
    #Give ragnar a texture on the back of his leather jacket with an "assgard" band logo
