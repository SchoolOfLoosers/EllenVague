    p "I mean, I don't want to keep you guessing, so why don't you come with me to welcome her?"

    p "Welcome, Miss Vague, it is an honor to have you here."
    mc "Hah, the honor is all mine. What a cozy little studio!"
    p "I know, right? Why do you think I spend nearly every night in here, talking into a microphone?"
    mc "I can imagine the view has something to do with it."
    p "Oh, absolutely, there is nothing better than sitting here, watching the sun disappearing behind the trees past the lake."
    p "But enough about me, I am sure our listeners haven't tuned in tonight to hear me wax about my cozy little studio."
    p "Before we start: Do your editors know you are here tonight?"
    mc "Oh no, they would probably panic if they knew I go anywhere without a stack of cards full of talking points."
    p "In that case, let me speak for all our listeners and promise that we will keep tonight a secret."
    mc "Hah, thank you."
    p "Now, I am sure you are already well-known around here, and I would bet that not a lot of people would admit as much."
    p "But please, for those who are not yet addicted to your works, would you quickly introduce yourself?"
    mc "Eh, sure. My name is Ellen Vague, and I write romance books for a living."
    p "Now, that is clearly selling it short, folks. Because when Ellen says romance, she means romance with a capital R, as in rawr."
    mc "That's...actually a really good tag line, do you mind if I steal that?"
    mc "I would love to put that on the back of the next book."
    p "Oh, totally. My own name on a certified Vague? Now, what do we say to that, folks?"
    p "Speaking of which, is there any telling when we can expect a new book from you?"
    mc "To be perfectly honest, I have not yet started to work on one, which is part of the reason I even came out here."
    mc "I just needed a vacation, to...refresh my mind, I guess."
    p "And haven't you come to the perfect place to do so!"
    p "Well, I am sure that I speak for my listeners when I say we would all love to see our small town of Bryatt Fowls serving as inspiration for some deep and dark secrets."
    p "Another question, if you don't mind."
    mc "Of course, I don't have anywhere to be tonight."
    p "I am glad to hear that."
    p "Well, I have wondered ever since you agreed to come out and up here."
    p "Any of those stories true? Or, you know, loosely based on actual events?"
    mc "Oh heavens no."
    mc "Not if there is a chance that my parents and my neighbor's wives are listening."
    p "Well, you heard it here first, folks, you better lock your husbands up when Miss Ellen Vague is in town."
    p "Thank you for coming here tonight, Miss Vague, and I can NOT wait to hold your next book in my hands."
    mc "Thank you for having me, Miss Maynard."
    p "Now, folks, excuse me for a moment while I bring Miss Vague to the door."
    p "Enjoy listening to some chill late night hip hop that I whipped up in honor of tonight."
    p "I called it \"Box of dirty tricks\", and if you don't get it, you weren't old enough to listen to this interview right now."
    p "The perfect tune to clear your earwaves, and I wager to say that not even our friends at the Odin's Diner can resist to nod their heads to this."

    p "Wait, let me check that the microphones are turned off..."
    p "Yep, looks safe enough."
    p "I hope that was fun for you. I know we aren't the biggest station around the country, but..."
    mc "Oh come on, this was way more fun than all those staged shows I normally take part in."
    mc "You have no idea how boring it is to sit there, reading what other people have agreed I can say on air."
    mc "Can you believe they have to run most of my interviews past their legal departments?"
    p "It's impressive how prudish people still are these days."
    mc "I guess it falls to a small town radio show host to show the big names in the industry how to create a comfortable interview environment."
    p "Hah, I'm glad you liked it."
    p "Listen, the reason I made sure to turn the microphones off is that I am totally not above asking you to sign one of my books of yours."
    p "Hope that's okay."
    mc "But of course."
    mc "I'm excited to see which ones you own."
    p "I only have four at the moment, "
