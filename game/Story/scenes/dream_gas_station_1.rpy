    "When I walked into the gas station, I could feel that something was wrong."
    "I could...feel, that I was caught in a dream, and yet somehow, that failed to ease my mind."
    "I was...in danger, not of waking up, but rather drifting deeper into the dream, the darkness, the..."
    "Twilight."
    "Inside the dream, I could remember who I was outside of it, that I was Ellen Vague, author and...woman, person, whatever you wanted to call it."
    "But here, and now, I was trapped inside my own head, and somehow I knew that if I were to die here, then I might not wake up again."
    "And somehow, this knowledge that they would find me, a few days too late, but not in some sort of murder mystery, but rather cozied up under my blanket..."
    "I could not stand that thought, and so I took out my trusty old fleshlight, and the gun that legally, I did not own - and walked into the gas station."

    shadow "Welcome, Miss Vague, is your car out of gas again?"
    shadow "Why yes, of course it is, the car is ALWAYS out of gas."
    shadow "Just like your stupid slut writer brain is always empty."
    shadow "You haven't written a single good book in your life, and not even a successful one for the past few years."

    "Somehow, that did it for me, and I had pure, unfiltered violence on my mind when I caught his eye with the fleshlight, then put a well-placed bullet right into his shadowy brain."
    "In my dreams, this always worked, flawlessly and without fail."
    "If only the real world could be easy like that sometimes."

    "But then again, as I collected the keys from the fading corpse of the gas station owner, I realized that it was time to wake up, before any of his shadowy friends could react to the shop."
