    "When I walked into the gas station, I could feel that something was wrong."

    "I was...in danger, not of waking up, but rather drifting deeper into the dream, the darkness, the..."
    "Twilight."
    "Inside the dream, I could remember who I was outside of it, that I was Ellen Vague, author and...woman, person, whatever you wanted to call it."
    "But here, and now, I was trapped inside my own head, and somehow I knew that if I were to die here, then I might not wake up again."
    "And somehow, this knowledge that they would find me, a few days too late, but not in some sort of murder mystery, but rather cozied up under my blanket..."
    "I could not stand that thought, and so I took out my trusty old fleshlight, and the gun that legally, I did not own - and walked into the gas station."

    "But then again, as I collected the keys from the fading corpse of the gas station owner, I realized that it was time to wake up, before any of his shadowy friends could react to the shot."
    "The only problem was, there was only one way to wake out of that dream..."
