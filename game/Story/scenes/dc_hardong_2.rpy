    #todo Check in, see your room, have your clothes taken away, meet the head nurse who ridicules us for being naked (you may be the doctor's new favorite pet, but around here, you do what we say), meet the male nurse who can't take their eyes off us. The nurse puts us through a rigorous course, and in the evening, we get to talk to the doctor and have a choice to snitch on the nurses. If we stay silent, the nurse gives us our socks back as a reward, and if we snitch, they take us to "the chair" where we are tied up all day, and occasionally visited by the male nurse, who masturbates in front of us. We can tell him to "at least fuck me and not just stand there."
    #todo when the head nurse visits us, we can pee on the floor, and if we do, she switches on the vibrator seat so that it vibrates for one minute every hour and tells us to to have fun, putting a clock in front of us. If we control our breathing and time it so that we orgasm, she calls us pathetic, but lets us out of the chair.
    #todo At this point, we have the option to leave the clinic, or stay, and if we complain to the doctor, he will fire the head nurse, who then becomes a shadow out of anger.
    #todo if we stay, we are allowed to go out into the main room to meet the other patients, but have to wear a buttplug tail and remain naked / with socks. This unlocks various conversations with the patients, and we can learn about the head nurse, and that she has a crush on the doctor, but that he told her off, and that is why she hates everyone he takes a liking to.
    #todo There is also a painter whom we can become friends with if we allow him to paint us naked, and he can paint us with one of various items that will help us during dream sequences.I(including a vibrator that allows us to come / wake up quickly / on demand to protect ourselves)
    #todo If we have the vibrator, we can go into the dream, enter the head nurses office, and read through her journal(?), then wake up quickly when she walks in. Here, we can discover incriminating information about her (She murdered the woman the doctor married, and wrote about it in her journal, including where she buried the body), and slip that to Sarah who then arrests the nurse. If she's arrested, we can visit her in her cell and gloat, and promise her to unlock the cell if she masturbates for us.
