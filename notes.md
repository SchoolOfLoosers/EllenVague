#Ellen Vague:

##Locations:
- Witch's hut
- Cavern with some kind of artefact in it
    Cavern of Whispers:
        A deep cavern filled with strange echoes and whispers. Those who enter may receive cryptic messages or warnings from unseen entities, guiding them or leading them astray.
- cemetery
- nightly lake where it's rumored that a wish can be granted if you are willing to sacrifice something (aka masturbation scene)
- Hedge labyrinth
- mental hospital
- One of the men has an observatory / alchemy lab? --> iggy for his potions
- An altar in the woods where we can get fucked as a sacrifice to summon some kind of shadow-demon?

##Events
- Sarah, Jaykill and Iggy/Ragnar are all part of a bookclub-boys-like structure where Jaykill hunts the shadows, Sarah makes sure the investigations go nowhere, iggy mixes potions for night vision and endurance etc., and ragnar hold the concerts out on his farm in the forest to draw the shadow's attention away from the town.
- Contrary to that, Patty uses her radio show to find impressionable guests and lure them into the shadows' hands.
- The Queen of the forest is a woman who walks the edge of the shadow plane, being able to exist around the shadows, but also around mere mortals. Give her some attributes like the log / lamp lady (cock lady like in twin cheeks?)
